## Outcomes ##
1. Establishing resource hierarcy
2. Implementing organizational policies
3. Managing projects and quotas

5. Applying access management

Setting up billing and monitoring the use of resouces are also things to consider

## Establishing resource hierarchy ##

The resource hierarchy consists of 4 levels.
* Organization level - Eg: Cymbal superstore
* Folder level - Eg: Supply chain app, E commerce app, Transportation app
* Project level - B2B dev, B2B staging, B2B production
* Resource level - EC2 instances, Cloud functions etc
Granting members IAM roles to ensure that they have the right access to the projects depending on their needs of their job and role is also part of setting up the cloud environment.
